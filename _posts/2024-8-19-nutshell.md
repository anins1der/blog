## q: what is dis?
## a: a tool that embeds info directly into the words.
for example:

yeah i am serious

## i bet that *explanation* didnt work very well :/
working on it…

[clears his throat]

are [:Wii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii) ready?

(that was a **bad** ***joke***)

# the (not so) great introduction of [:nutshell](https://ncase.me/nutshell/#)s' use cases!

imagine you are building a website about [:cats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat).

would you prefer this: 
<script type="text/javascript">
  <BUTTON TYPE="button" ONCLICK="alert(\"fun fact:\n\ncats only meow when they are cute kittens. however, they learn that us (humans) find this interesting and they keep meowing to us. they only meow because it it interesting.\n/^---^\\ \n(· w ·)">meowseful info!</BUTTON>
</script>

or this: [:meowseful info](fun fact: cats only meow when they are cute kittens. however, they learn that us *humans* find this interesting and they keep meowing to us. they only meow because it it interesting.)

cmon i made the latter button less interesting :p
