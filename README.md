# how did i do it?

simple :)
click [**use this template that i used**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) or take a look at ["Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme"](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

it has a lot of these:

- dummy posts
- sample top navigation
- a sidebar (wow)
- footer links (links at the bottom of the page)
- paginated home page (w h a t ?)
- archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag (noice)
- sample about page
- sample 404 page
- site-wide search

edit dummy contents with your own and [configure them as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

# Troubleshooting

i srsly don't know what im doing, so reat these:


"If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:"

- ["Ruby 101"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)
- ["Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
- ["Configuring GitHub Metadata"](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.
