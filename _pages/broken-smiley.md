you won't care, i know

but… read it once

# i need your help-

here is a thing you didn't notice:

there is a "**:)**" mask i wear **all the time**, so you wouldn't see "*sad anins1der*"[^1] or smth

i guess that "**:)**" is, slowly but surely, shredding into smol pieces *day by day*

did you noticed it?

you: "10/10 art"
me: "**:)**"
me: ":|"
me: "**:))**"

more "**smileys**"

uh, *help me, plz*

## …

…

**true friend** ***:)***…

uh

~~*i just need someone to* **touch** *me once in a while*~~ i just need some *:)*
